### Description
- When travelling it's always ideal to have a local's suggestions on where to go. Looking up "Top 10 things to do in X place" works and all but nothing like a local's perspective. I feel blessed to call Puerto Rico, a small island located in the Caribbean, my home. Through Islander PR I aim to share what makes Puerto Rico so great from my perspective. I hope you enjoy this blog and make the most of your time in the island.
