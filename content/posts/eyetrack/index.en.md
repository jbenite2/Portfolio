### Description
- During the spring semester of my senior year in college,  my team of 3 utilized cutting-edge technologies like OpenFace, MediaPipe, and PyTorch to develop a sophisticated computer vision model. This model was designed to precisely detect and track a subject's gaze direction in real-time using a live camera feed. Our goal extended beyond interpreting the data for precise mouse movements; we aimed to integrate comprehensive gesture recognition functionalities, encompassing clicking and gesturing.
