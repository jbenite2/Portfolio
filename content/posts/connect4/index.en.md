### Description
- Developed an unbeatable Connect 4 AI machine alongside a group of "preternship" software engineers. Utilized backtracking, recursion, and the Mini-Max Algorithm for optimal gameplay.
- The minimax algorithm is a common technique used in AI to make decisions and determine optimal moves in games. It works by simulating all possible moves and evaluating the outcome of each move to select the best one. 

### Step 1
  - [Click here to download file](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/jbenite2/Connect4/blob/master/connect4.py)

### Step 2
  -  Open the file and add a shebang on the top of it that references your computer's python interpreter
     - If you're using MacOS, this is it:
       ```python
       #!/usr/bin/env python
       ```

### Step 3
  - Give the file appropriate permissions

      ```bash
      chmod +x path/to/connect4.py
      ```

### Step 4
  - Run python file

      ```bash
      ./path/to/connect4.py
      ```
