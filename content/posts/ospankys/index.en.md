### Description
- During my time at Notre Dame, our team embarked on a semester-long project for the Databases course, where we identified and resolved a pressing issue on campus. Our focus was on enhancing the operational efficiency of the restaurant at O'Neill Family Hall, which was still relying on outdated inventory management and client order placement methods.
- To tackle this challenge, we assembled a robust technology stack consisting of React.js, Node.js, and PlanetScale. Leveraging the power of Amplify, we seamlessly deployed our frontend solution. On the backend, we utilized Nginx to run a Node script continuously, serving as a vital middleware component connecting the client side with our database.
- By employing this innovative technology stack and implementing streamlined processes, we successfully modernized the inventory management and client order system at O'Neill Family Hall's restaurant, greatly improving its overall operations.
